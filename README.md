# SQL Database Creation and Calls

## Data Modeling
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.


## Data Engineering
Use the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
